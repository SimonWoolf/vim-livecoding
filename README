In early stages of experimental playing around. Not remotely usable yet.

TODO:
- fork em, make changes on that, then use my fork in gemfile
- decide what to do if diff > max DGRAM size (~212000 bytes)
- deal with case fork already started. (another buffer?)

notes to self
=============
do not attempt to puts anything to stdout, it'll mess up the terminal. put it
to stderr and run gvim, that prints stderr to the console.
