In early stages of experimental playing around. Not remotely usable yet.

TODO:
- use datagram socket rather than stream. figure out how to do that with
  eventmachine, connect_unix_domain currently forces stream. want to keep
  messages distinct. also UNIXServer ruby module forces stream atm. grr.
  maybe simpler to keep as stream -- test if stream behaves messagelike if
  there are newlines between messages. (but then how will it deal with newlines
  in the message, eg in the diff?)
- any advantage to switching to socket client on the main thread and server on em?
- any way to use one half of a socket pair in eventmachine?
